# ===================================
# Automagik Tools Hub - Zero Configuration
# ===================================
#
# The Hub uses a database-first configuration approach.
# After running the setup wizard at /setup, all configuration
# is stored in the encrypted SQLite database.
#
# This .env file is ONLY needed for bootstrap (before database exists).
# All other configuration is managed through:
#   - Setup Wizard: /setup (WorkOS credentials, admin emails, network config)
#   - Tool Catalogue: /catalogue (per-tool OAuth, API keys, parameters)
#
# See docs/CONFIGURATION.md for complete configuration guide.

# Database Path (Bootstrap Only)
# Override only if you need a custom database location
# Default: ./data/hub.db
HUB_DATABASE_PATH=./data/hub.db

# ===================================
# That's it! 🎉
# ===================================
# Visit http://localhost:8884/setup to configure your Hub
